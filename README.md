## Werewolf Minigame

This game is an adaptation of the "Werewolf" designed to be played on Minecraft with some additional action elements.

### Roles

- There are a total of 5 possible roles in this game: `Villager`, `Werewolf`, `Traitor`, `Vampire`, `Possessed`.
- The **villagers** win by eliminating all the werewolves.
- The **werewolves** win by eliminating all the villagers. Note that werewolves can see the nametags of each other.
- The **traitor** is a villager on the werewolves' side.
- The **vampire** will be the unique winner if he is alive and either the villagers or the werewolves get wiped out. The vampire is immortal during night time.
- The **possessed** is a villager, who thinks of himself as a normal villager but appears as a werewolf upon divination.

### In-game Process

- The game follows a cycle of day time and night time.
- During night time, no discussion is allowed, and skeletons will spawn within the game's area.
- The skeletons have a chance of dropping emeralds, the currency of this game.
- When day time arrives, all remaining skeletons despawn and discussion is allowed.
- Shops are scattered around the map where weapons and special items can be purchased using the emeralds.
- Using these items, find out the members of the opposing factions, annihilate them, and seize your victory.
